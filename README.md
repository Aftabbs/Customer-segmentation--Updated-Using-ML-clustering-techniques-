# Project Title-Customer Segmentation using Mall Customers Dataset

# Project Description
In this project, we aim to perform customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset. We use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data, treat outliers, and perform standard scaling to prepare the data for clustering. We then use the silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters and create plots to visualize the clusters.

# Dataset Description
The Mall Customers dataset contains information about customers in a mall, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

# Techniques Used
-Exploratory data analysis
-Outlier treatment
-Standard scaling
-Silhouette score(to determine optimal Cluster Value)
-Cluster Analysis and Cluster  visualization
